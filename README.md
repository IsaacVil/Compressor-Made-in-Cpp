# Compressor and Decompressor Made in C++

## About the Project  
The **Compressor and Decompressor** is a tool developed as part of the **Data Structures** course at the **Technological Institute of Costa Rica (TEC).** This project focuses on the implementation of compression and decompression algorithms using advanced **data structures**, such as **Huffman Trees, Heaps, and Linked Lists**.  
The primary goal of this project is to efficiently compress and decompress text-based files using lossless compression techniques, while applying data structure concepts to enhance performance.  
This project was a collaborative effort between **Isaac Villalobos** and **Kevin Vega**, showcasing our understanding of compression algorithms and their implementation using various data structures.  
Any questions or inquiries about the inner workings of the project can be directed to my personal email: IsaacVillalobosB@gmail.com.

## Features
- **File Compression**: Compresses text-based files using a user-defined algorithm.
- **File Decompression**: Decompresses compressed files to retrieve the original data.
- **Data Structure Integration**:
  - **Huffman Trees**: Used for efficient compression of text based on frequency of characters.
  - **Heaps**: Utilized to build the Huffman Tree and prioritize characters for compression.
  - **Linked Lists**: Applied for managing sequences of data during the compression and decompression processes.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Compression Methods**: Custom lossless compression algorithms based on data structures  
- **Data Structures**: Huffman Trees, Heaps, Linked Lists  
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2022  
- **Version Control**: GitHub
